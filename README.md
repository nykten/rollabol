# _Roll-a-ball... in XR!_
## Made for COMPSCI5117 Extended Reality Interactions Course at the University of Glasgow (2024)

This is my implementation of Unity's Roll-a-ball project and integrating the XR Interaction toolkit.

### Project Aims:
* To learn the basics of Unity Development through tutorials
* To adapt the original game made for desktop environment into an XR environment.
* To use spatial interactions nicely in tandem with the game's objective.
* To also make rationalisation of the design choices made when adapting the game into XR environment with respect to related literatures.

### What I've done:
* Modified the XR Device simulation library's movement controls to keep the top-down perspective of the original game.
* Implemented grab interactions using simulated controllers to move the ball. Can also be thrown around!
* Implemented teleportation as the locomotion method to 'move' around different perspective of the top-down view.
* Included sound effect when teleporting to emphasize completed task.
* Included affordances for grabbing the ball and selecting the teleportable places.
